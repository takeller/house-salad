# Refactor notes
I refactored the code to be more encapsulated. We have a PropublicaService which is responsible for making the connection with the Propublica API and sending any requests I need. The SearchResults PORO is used as a middleman to take the result of the API call and create an object to hold the information I want. The result of this is that the Search controller is skinny and only needs two lines of code to grab data from the API and pass it to the view.
